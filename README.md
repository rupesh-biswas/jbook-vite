# JBook

---

This is an interactive coding environment. You can write Javascript, see it executed, and write comprehensive documentation using markdown.

- Click any text cell (inclluding this one) to edit it.
- The code in each code editor is all joined together into one file. If you define a variable in cell #1, you can refer to it in any following cell!
- You can <span style="color: orange;">show</span> any React component, string, number, or anything else by calling the show function. This is a function built into this environment. Call show multiple times to show multiple values.
- Re-order or delete cells using the button on the top right.
- Add new cells by hovering on the divider between each cell.

To have a local deployment, run <span style="color:orange;"> npx jsnote-rupesh serve</span>, all of the text and code you write will be saved to the notebook.js file.

Code for this website is present here: [jbook-vite](https://github.com/rupesh-biswas/jbook-vite).

And code for the npm package is present here: [jbook-rupesh](https://github.com/rupesh-biswas/practice/tree/main/React-and-Typescript/jbook-using-vite)

I learned this project though this udemy course: [React and Typescript: Build a Portfolio Project](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-and-typescript-build-a-portfolio-project/)
